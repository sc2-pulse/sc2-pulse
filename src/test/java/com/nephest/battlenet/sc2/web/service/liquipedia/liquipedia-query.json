There, he defeated fan favorite [[Cella]] 2-1 <ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=152673 GSL 2012 Open Season 1 Round of 64 Days 1-4 Recap]</ref> to advance to the Ro32, where he lost 0-2 to [[San]].<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=155796 GSL 2010 Open Season 1 Round of 32 Recap]</ref>  The series against San would be Maru's last games in the GSL for almost a year; he did not qualify for Code A until [[2011 Global StarCraft II League August/Code A|GSL August]], where he fell 0-2 to [[Fruitdealer]] in the Round of 32.  Maru's attempts to qualify for [[2011 Global StarCraft II League October/Preliminaries|GSL October]] and [[2011 Global StarCraft II League November/Preliminaries|GSL November]] also failed, though the single game he took off of [[Curious]] during the October preliminaries was Curious's only loss that season.\n\n2012 proved a much better year for Maru.  He started out the year strong, qualifying for Code A in the [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 1/Preliminaries|2012 GSL Season 1 preliminaries]] and defeating [[Noblesse]] and [[Yeah]] in the process.  His first match in the Ro48 was a 2-0 win against favored<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=311761 GSL 2012 Season 1 Code A Week Three Preview]</ref> opponent [[MorroW]]. Then, in the Ro32, he managed to beat [[Happy (Korean player)|Happy]] 2-1 before dropping to [[NaDa]] 2-0 in the Ro24.  The loss sent him to the [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Up and Down|Up and Down]] matches, where he showed that he had the skill of a Code S player by defeating [[sC]], [[Terius]], [[Alicia]], and [[JYP]] to earn a Code S spot.<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=320735 GSL 2012 Season 1 Up/Down Match Day 3 Recap]</ref>\n\nMaru entered his first Code S tournament, [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code S|2012 GSL Season 2]], in a group with [[GuMiho]], [[Curious]], and [[HerO]]. Despite low expectations,<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=324108 GSL 2012 Season 2 Code S Day 2 Preview]</ref><ref>[https://tl.net/liquibet2/betcomments.php?liquibet=113 GSL 2012 Season 2 Code S Day 2 Liquibet]</ref> he defeated GuMiho and HerO to earn first in the group<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=324362 GSL 2012 Season 2 Code S Day 2 Recap]</ref> and move on to the Ro16.  There, he defeated [[MC]] 2-1, but then lost to [[Squirtle]] 0-2 and [[Oz]] 1-2 to finish third in his group.  He now faces [[Creator]] in the Ro24 of Code A.<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=337864 GSL 2012 Season 2 Code A Round of 24 Day 2 Preview]</ref> Maru lost 0-2 and fell into [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Up and Down|Up and Downs]], finishing second in his group with only one loss to [[Curious]] and securing his [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|Season 3 Code S]] spot. There he ultimately lost in Ro32, after losing to [[DongRaeGu]] and [[viOlet]], and despite beating [[Oz]]. In Ro32 of [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code A|Code A]], he lost to [[Polt]], falling into [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 4/Up and Down|Up and Downs]] again. He was able to beat only [[aLive]] there and after losing to [[HerO]], [[SuHoSin]] and [[Shine (Choi Kyung Min)|Shine]], he fell to Code A.\n\nIn [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 4/Code A|GSL Season 4 Code A]], he beat [[EffOrt]], [[asd]] and [[JYP]] to come back into Code S for Season 5. However, [[2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 5/Code S|Code S]] was not pleasant to Maru, and he was swept in his Ro32 group by [[Curious]] and [[Soulkey]] and fell into Code A again, where he lost 1-2 to [[KangHo|Losira]] in the Ro48 and got eliminated out of GSL.\n\nIn the last Wings of Liberty GSL, Maru qualified through the Preliminaries to [[2013 Global StarCraft II League Season 1/Code A|Code A]], where he was able to beat [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]], but lost to [[Sniper]] in Ro32. He was able to win his group in [[2013 WCS Season 1 Korea GSL/Up and Down|Up and Down]] though and participated in the first [[2013 WCS Season 1 Korea GSL/Code S|WCS GSL]].\n\nIn addition to his GSL success, Maru has also done remarkably well in the [[Korean StarCraft II League Daily/2012/Team League - Season 1|2012 KSL team league Season 1]], where he finished with a 19-7 record, including a 6-kill all-kill of team [[StarTale]].\n\n===Outside Korea===\n\nMaru played in only one offline foreign tournament during Wings of Liberty: the [[IGN ProLeague Season 4|IPL 4]] on April 6, 2012. IGN awarded him a spot in the [[IGN ProLeague Season 4/Open Bracket|Open Bracket]] because his team, [[Prime]], was playing in the GSTL finals, which were also hosted at IPL 4. Maru's performance was not especially strong, however; he only defeated [[CatZ]] 2-1 and [[Illusion (American player)|Illusion]] 2-0 before falling 0-2 to [[TaeJa]] and 1-2 to [[Virus (player)|Virus]]. \n\nMaru competed in the online [[Asia Starcraft League]] from August 7, 2012, to February 7, 2013. He easily reached the bracket stage, going 4-1 in each of the group stages. In the winner's bracket, he defeated notable Chinese players [[F91]] and [[MacSed]] 2-0 each in the second and third rounds of the bracket stage and defeated the Taiwanese player [[Sen]] 3-1 in the fourth round. He faced fellow Korean [[BboongBboong]] twice, in the semi-finals and the grand finals, defeating him 3-2 both times to win the tournament.\n\n==Heart of the Swarm==\n\nAfter entering the [[2013 WCS Season 1 Korea GSL/Code S|WCS Korea Season 1 GSL]], Maru, despite beating [[BBoongBBoong]], lost to both [[Soulkey]] and [[Flash]] and fell into Code A again.\n\n===Rise to Championship===\nMaru was able to qualify for [[2013 WCS Season 2 Korea OSL/Premier|WCS Korea 2013 Season 2 Premier League]], hosted by OGN, through the [[2013 WCS Season 2 Korea OSL/Up and Down|Up and Down matches]] by losing to [[Leenock]] and winning against [[Ruin]], [[Bunny (Korean player)|Bunny]] and [[DongRaeGu]]. He defeated [[sOs]] twice in the round of 32, and [[Trap]] and [[SuperNova]] 2-1 each in the round of 16 to reach the bracket stage of the tournament. After handily defeating perennial Code S/Premier League player [[Symbol]], he was matched against the WCS Season 1 Finals champion [[INnoVation]]. According to the TeamLiquid Power Rank and Aligulac rating website, INnoVation was rated the best player in the world at the time, and was the heavy favorite in the matchup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/419995-sc2-power-rank-july-2013|title=SC2 Power Rank - July 2013|author=monk|publisher=TL.net|date=2013-07-03|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aligulac.com/periods/89/?sort=&race=ptzrs&nats=all|title=List 89|publisher=Aligulac.com|date=2013-07-24|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> However, by using highly varying, cheesy, and aggressive builds, Maru was able to take the first three games without difficulty, and took advantage of a shaken up INnoVation to close the series 4-0 in a fairly standard game. This brought him to the first finals of his career against [[Rain (Korean Protoss)|Rain]], where after dropping the initial two games, Maru took the third game with a proxy 11/11 which gave him the momentum to end up winning the championship 4-2.\n\n===\"Marine Prince\" near the top===\n\nAfter winning the last OSL, Maru flew to Cologne, to participate in [[2013 WCS Season 2|WCS Season 2 Finals]] at GamesCom. He was placed in a group with [[Team Acer]] duo in [[Scarlett]] and [[MMA]] and [[Evil Geniuses]]' [[aLive]]. After unexpectedly losing to aLive, Maru beat fellow Terran player MMA. But the next day, he fell after a failed proxy to Scarlett, finishing the tournament at 9th-12th place, getting 750 WCS points and $5,000.\n\nSoon after it, Maru entered [[2013 WCS Season 3 Korea GSL|Season 3 WCS GSL]] as a relative favourite, still not being considered as a top contender, especially after a tough loss at Season Finals. He took first place of his Ro32 group after beating [[Sleep]] and [[Bbyong]], moving into Ro16. There, he met [[Flash]], [[PartinG]] and [[KangHo]]. An initial loss to PartinG did not throw him off and after winning against KangHo and Flash, \"Marine Prince\" moved into his second playoff bracket in a row, and his first ever GSL top 8.\n\nIn the top 8, he met the former GSL champion [[jjakji]] and beat him 3-1, but soon after, Maru lost 1-3 to the future [[Royal Road]]er [[Dear]], finishing this season at 3rd-4th place, securing a place at WCS Season 3 Finals and a seed for the next season of GSL.\n\nWhen [[2013 WCS Season 3|Season 3 Finals]] started, Maru was considered as one of main favourites this time. After beating [[soO]] and [[duckdeok]], Maru moved into the playoff bracket where he met [[MMA]] once again, this time with the latter being WCS Europe champion. Despite dropping the first map, Maru prevailed 3-1 and moved into the top 4 where he met [[Dear]] again. Maru lost 1-3 again, and finished with another semifinal appearance. Two games of this series are featured in TL.net's list of the Best Games of 2013, as #27 and #6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/439620-the-best-games-of-2013|title=The Best Games of 2013|author=lichter|publisher=TL.net|date=2013-12-31|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Maru accumulated enough points to enter the final stage of the season - [[2013 WCS Global Finals|WCS Global Finals]] in Anaheim. Being 7th seed, he dropped [[MC]] 3-1 in first round with relative ease, and moved on to play another Protoss player, [[duckdeok]], who just eliminated [[INnoVation]]. In a long-fighting series, Maru prevailed 3-2 and moved into his third consecutive top 4, where he met another fan favourite, [[Jaedong]]. In an exciting series, causing huge cheers from the crowd, Maru ultimately lost 1-3 and fell in another semifinal.\n\nBecause of his OSL championship, Maru was invited to play in the [[Hot6ix Cup]]. He met [[soO]] in first round, eliminating [[SK Telecom T1]]'s player from tournament with 3-0 score. Then, he faced [[Soulkey]], the \"Iron Wall\" Zerg player, who outplayed Maru, and sent the \"Marine Prince\" to prepare for the following season with a 3-1 score, eliminating him in his fourth semifinal in a row.\n\nOn 13 December 2013, Maru left [[Prime]] and moved into [[Jin Air Green Wings]] with [[sOs]].\n\nMaru entered new season of [[2014 Global StarCraft II League Season 1/Code S|Code S]] being one of three remaining Terran players, after [[jjakji]] moved to WCS Europe. In the Ro32, he lost his initial match against [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]], but after a series of comebacks, he won against Zerg players [[Symbol]] and [[Hydra]] to move into the Ro16. \n\nAfter groups were announced, many thought that Maru was done.{{who}} Maru had his two main nemeses, [[Soulkey]] and [[Dear]], and [[KT Rolster]]'s ace [[Zest]] in his group. Despite losing the then-fastest game in GSL history to Zest after a scouted proxy rax on [[Daedalus Point]], Maru was able to beat Dear this time in winners match, therefore avoiding Soulkey and moving into the Ro8 as first place. However, there he met [[Startale]]'s [[Life]] and lost 2-3, stopping his series of semifinals appearances but securing his seed for next GSL anyway.\n\nIn the next [[2014 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code S|GSL Code S]], Maru was one of the four Terran players. He swept his Ro32 group, 4-0'ing [[MyuNgSiK]] and [[DongRaeGu]]. After losing a macro game to [[SK Telecom T1]]'s Zerg [[Dark]], Maru cheesed his way into the Ro8 after destroying Zerg's defences and abusing [[Stork]] for not scouting properly, securing his sixth playoffs appearance in a row. \n\nIn the quarterfinals, the young Terran met [[Soulkey]], who was at 13-3 winning record against Maru. However, Maru prevailed 3-1 and moved into the semifinals. There, he met [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]] and lost 2-4 in a back-and-forth series, to finish in another semifinal and watch Classic ultimately winning the championship.\n\nBeing already qualified for [[2014 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|Season 3]], Maru got placed into the same group as [[Reality]], [[Trap]] and [[Hush]], where he took first place taking down the two Protoss players. Now in the Ro16, he was placed to be in a group with [[INnoVation]], [[PartinG]] and [[Stats]], losing to both PartinG and Stats, and taking last place in his group and getting eliminated from the GSL Season 3 Code S.\n\n==2015==\n\n===One of the Best Terran Players in the World===\nIn December 2014, Maru qualified for the newly introduced [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1|StarCraft II StarLeague]], defeating [[DeParture]], [[Check (Kim Min Gyu)|Check]] and [[Solar]] and thus qualifying for the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1/Challenge|Challenge Series]]. Only a few days later, he attended the [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 1/Qualifier|GSL Season 1 Qualifier]], where he got byes for the first two rounds, before dropping to the lower bracket due to a loss to TY. In the bottom bracket however, he defeated both [[Impact]] and [[Shine (Lee Young Han)]] 2 to nothing to eventually move into GSL Code S. He was then seeded to play the international seed [[Jim]] in the SSL Challenge series, whom he beat 3-1 in a rather quick series, to move through to the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1/Main Event|Main Event]]. In the [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 1/Code S|GSL Code S]] Round of 32, he was put into a group with [[PartinG]], [[First]] and [[Hack]]. While being able to beat Hack 2-1, he then lost to PartinG 0-2, to face First in the deciders match, who he ended up beating 2-0 moving through to the Round of 16. Only a week after, he was playing at the [[IEM Season IX - Taipei|IEM Taipei]] to which he qualified, by beating [[Sorry]], [[Rogue]], [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]] and [[DeParture]]. Being one of the strongest players at the time, he was regarded as one of the favorites to win the entire tournament, with only [[Life]] given top priority, due to recent results. In the group stage, Maru was once again seeded into the same group as [[PartinG]], as well as [[Hydra]] and [[TRUE]]. He beat the two Zergs 2-0 each, but once again lost his series against PartinG, advancing to the Ro8 in second place. There, he met [[herO(jOin)|herO]], whom he beat convincingly 3-1, and moved through to face Soulkey next, whom he beat 3-1 as well. From there on, he went to the final, now facing Life. He started the series off by losing a single game, before winning the next three. However he was not able to close the series out, as Life took one map after another and in the end took the series, leaving Maru finishing as the second place.\n\nBack in Korea, Maru was going to play his SSL Round of 16 group after that, where he was facing the group of Death in [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]], [[Dark]] and [[TY]]. Although losing to Dream in his first series of the day, he managed to come back from the losers match, beating both TY and Dark 2-0 to move through in second place. In his Round of 8 match, he was facing [[Leenock]]. He dominated the series 3-0 going to the Round of 4, where he was going to meet [[Stats]]. Before that however, he was supposed to play his GSL Round of 16 group, where he was once again matched in the same group as PartinG, as well as herO and [[MC]]. Although managing to defeat Parting 2-1 in their first series of the day, he then lost to herO in the Winner's match, once again putting him against PartinG in the decider, to whom he once again lost 0-2, kicking him out of Season 1 Code S and placing him into [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code A|Season 2 Code A]]. Shortly after he faced Stats in the SSL Semifinals, beating him 4-2, as he moved on to the grand finals.\n\nDue to his second place at the Intel Extreme Masters Taipei, Maru was qualified for the [[IEM Season IX - World Championship|Intel Extreme Masters World Championship]] in Katowice. There, he met [[Patience]] in the first round. He absolutely dominated the Protoss, leaving no chance and beating him 3-0, to advance to the Round of 8, where he then met Dark and lost to him 0-3. With a disappointing run in Katowice, Maru had to go back to Korea to play out the SSL finals a week later, in which he beat [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]] 4-1, claiming his second Premier League title, as well as being the first ever StarCraft II StarLeague Champion.\n\nBeing automatically qualified for the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Main Event|Starcraft 2 Starleague Season 2]] due to being placed in the top 4 of the last season, Maru only had to go through GSL Code A this season, where he met [[Billowy]] whom he beat in rather dominant fashion 3-0, once again qualifying for Code S. Being already qualified for SSL, Maru was placed into a group with [[Zest]], [[Hurricane]] and [[Leenock]], where he beat Zest and Hurricane convincingly in his at the time strongest match-up TvP, only dropping a single map to Hurricane, once again moving through to the Round of 8.\n\nOnly shortly later, Maru was able to lead his team, the Jin Air Green Wings to victory against [[KT Rolster]] in the [[2015 Proleague/Round 2|2015 Proleague 2nd Round]] Semifinals, taking out [[Zest]] once again as well as [[Life]] and [[Stats]]. While he was fielded in the finals against [[CJ Entus]], just as the series was tied 3-3, he was crushed by [[ByuL]], ending the series with a 3-4 defeat and a second place for his team.\n\nA few days after, Maru was once again matched against ByuL, this time in a Best of 5 series during the [[2015 KeSPA Cup Season 1|KeSPA Cup Season 1]] RO16. The series was much closer than his defeat in Proleague, but still ended with a 2-3 defeat for the Jin Air Terran, signaling the early end of his run at this tournament. Shortly after, his GSL group was played out, where he one more time met [[ByuL]] in his first match. Once again the series was close, but this time Maru won 2-1, and moved on to the winners match against KT Rolster's [[TY]]. He beat him 2-1 in another close TvT series, and moved on to the Round of 16.\n\nOn May 21, Maru participated in the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Main Event|Starcraft 2 Starleague Season 2]] Round of 8 against [[herO(jOin)|herO]].  He lost the match 3-2, ending his defense of his title from the previous season.  His performance in the [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code S|Season 2 Code S]] Round of 16 was more positive.  Maru placed first in Group A which consisted of [[Life]], [[Bomber]] and [[MyuNgSiK]] who took second place.  By taking first place in the group, Maru advanced to the Round of 8.  He would find himself paired against [[Rain (Korean Protoss)|Rain]].  For the second time, Maru found himself ousted by a Protoss as Rain claimed a 3-1 victory.  Although these results were disappointing, his top 8 performance in Season 2 Code S seeded him directly past the [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code A|2015 GSL Season 3 Code A]] into [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|2015 GSL Season 3 Code S]].  In the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 3|Starcraft 2 Starleague Season 3]], Maru had to play against [[Sora]] in the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 3/Challenge|2015 Starcraft II StarLeague Season 3 Challenge]] event.  He prevailed 3-1, once more qualifying him for both of the major Starleagues.  Meanwhile, Maru had continued his success in [[2015 Proleague]].  He posted an impressive 6-2 record, only losing to [[ByuL]] twice and going 5-0 versus Protoss, including victories against [[Stats]] and [[Dear]].  [[Jin Air Green Wings]] would finish with a 4-3 record and the third seed going into the playoffs.  In the first series versus [[CJ Entus]], [[sOs]] would claim an all-kill, but in the subsequent round, against [[KT Rolster]], it would be Maru who would claim four straight wins.  By beating [[Zest]], [[Life]], [[Stats]], and [[Flash]] consecutively, Maru propelled the Jin Air Green Wings into the [[2015 Proleague/Round 3|Proleague Round 3]] Finals where they would face [[SK Telecom T1]].  Maru would defeat [[INnoVation]] and [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]] in that match, but he would eventually fall to [[Dark]] as [[SK Telecom T1]] claimed the 2015 Proleague Round 3 title.\n\nIn the individual leagues, Maru would find mixed results.  Placed in Group Stats of [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 3/Main Event|2015 Starcraft 2 StarLeague Season 3]], Maru and the group's namesake would find themselves eliminated by [[ByuL]] and [[Zest]] with Maru losing to [[Zest]] in the fifth match.\n\nQualified into the [[2015 KeSPA Cup Season 2|KeSPA Cup Season 2]] by virtue of his performance in [[2015 Proleague/Round 3|2015 Proleague Round 3]], Maru would face off against [[Impact]] in the round of 16.  Despite his struggles against Zerg, Maru managed a 3-1 victory.  He would be eliminated in the next round by [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]] who successfully avenged his loss in the [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1|StarCraft II StarLeague]] earlier in the year.\n\n[[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|Season 3 Code S]] started more successfully.  Maru topped Group B which contained [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]], [[Bomber]] and [[Trust]].\nAll the while, the [[Jin Air Green Wings]] were struggling in [[2015 Proleague/Round 4|Proleague Round 4]].  Maru posted a 0-5 record, a clear indication that the form displayed during [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1/Main Event|Starcraft 2 Starleague Season 1]] eluded him.  [[Jin Air Green Wings]] would miss the Proleague Round 4 playoffs, which, when concluded, placed them in fourth place overall going into the [[2015 Proleague/Playoffs|2015 Proleague Playoffs]].\n\nDespite his dip in Best-of-1 matches, Maru continued to experience success in individual leagues.  In the Round of 16 of [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|Season 3 Code S]], Maru was placed into an idyllic group with 3 Protoss players.  Maru would finish the group in first with [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]] claiming second place, and [[herO(jOin)|herO]] and [[sOs]] finding themselves eliminated.  Maru's results placed him against his teammate [[Rogue]] in the round of 8.  He would effortlessly dispatch [[Rogue]] 3-1.  This landed him in a semifinal against long time nemesis [[INnoVation]].  Innovation was enjoying great success due to his usage of the resurgent Mech style.  Maru was clearly the inferior player in the series, which he lost 4-1.\n\nWith the individual leagues completed for the year, Maru found himself in second place in the [[2015 StarCraft II World Championship Series/Standings|WCS Series Standings]].  Once again he found himself paired against [[Rogue]] a player he had displayed dominance over during [[2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|Season 3 Code S]].\n\nMaru had little impact in the first round of the [[2015 Proleague/Playoffs|2015 Proleague Playoffs]].  Paired against [[KT Rolster]] he won his match against [[Life]] in the Proleague format match.  [[sOs]] then recorded a reverse all-kill after [[Flash]] defeated [[Trap]], [[Rogue]] and Maru in that order.\nAgainst [[CJ Entus]], Maru defeated [[RagnaroK]] in the Proleague format, but was not fielded in the all-kill format.  [[Cure]] and Rogue would each notch a victory before sOs took the final two maps to give the [[Jin Air Green Wings]] a 4-2 victory.\n\nIn the last major event for Maru before the WCS Global Finals, he and his team faced off against [[SK Telecom T1]] in the [[2015 Proleague/Playoffs|2015 Proleague Grand Finals]].  Maru was defeated by [[Dream (Korean Terran player)|Dream]] which contributed to a 4-2 defeat of the [[Jin Air Green Wings]].\n\nMaru's displays had been inconsistent in the latter portion of 2015.  He had shown brilliance versus Protoss, but had experienced great difficulty versus Zerg and an inability to combat Mech in the TvT match-up.\nMaru's downward trend concluded in a 3-0 defeat to Rogue at the [[2015 WCS Global Finals]].\nAs Heart of the Swarm concluded, it appeared as if Maru's supposed wrists problems were heavily taxing him.  He would not compete in any of the Legacy of the Void online events that were held by various organizers throughout the end of the year.\n\n==Legacy of the Void==\n\n===2015===\n\nContinuing with his disappointing results from BlizzCon 2015, Maru's initial forays into Legacy of the Void were largely unsuccessful.  On December 17, 2015 Maru was a participant in Group B of the [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1/Qualifier|StarLeague Season 1 Qualifier]].  Despite receiving a bye and winning his subsequent match, he then lost to [[Soulkey]].  After defeating [[Bomber]], he lost to [[ByuL]] in the decisive match.  As a result of finishing third in his group Maru did not qualify for the 16-man [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1]].\n\n===2016===\n\nMaru did not appear in another televised match until February 2, 2016.  The day after claiming a victory against [[Blaze]] in Week 1 of Round 1 of the [[2016 Proleague/Round 1|Proleague Round 1]], Maru faced off against Zest in 2016 [[2016 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code A|GSL Season 1 Code A]].  He lost 3-0 and was eliminated from both individual leagues.\n\nWith GSL and SSL no longer priorities, Maru focused solely on [[2016 Proleague]].  He finished [[2016 Proleague/Round 1|Round 1]] with a perfect record of 5-0.  Not only was this the second highest number of victories of any player, but [[soO]] was the only other player with more than one win to post an undefeated record.  Maru's victories in Round 1 included wins over [[Dear]] and [[INnoVation]] in consecutive weeks.  In the Gold Challenger Match of the Round 1 Playoffs, Maru defeated [[Stats]], [[TY]] and [[Leenock]] before losing to [[Zest]].  This performance catapulted the [[Jin Air Green Wings]] to the Round Final.  It was there that Maru would defeat [[MyuNgSiK]] before falling to [[soO]].  Jin Air Green Wings went on to lose the match 4-2.\n\nMaru continued his undefeated streak during [[2016 Proleague/Round 2|Round 2]].  He went 6-0, leading [[Jin Air Green Wings]] to a first place record going into the Playoffs.  Wins over [[Solar]], [[aLive]], [[Stats]], [[GuMiho]] and Dark made Maru's performance one of the most impressive in recent Proleague history at the time.  In the Round 2 Final against [[KT Rolster]], Maru came out in the Ace Match and defeated Zest to break [[Jin Air Green Wings]]'s mark of finishing second during four of the last five rounds of Proleague.\n\nMeanwhile, Maru competed in the [[2016 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Qualifier|GSL Season 2 Qualifier]] on May 11, 2016.  He won his group and advanced to [[2016 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code A|Code A]].  The next day he participated in the [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Qualifier|StarLeague Season 2 Qualifier]].  He was placed into Group 5.  He won his group placing him into [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Challenge|Challenge]].  For the first time in Legacy of the Void, Maru would participate in both individual leagues as well as Proleague at the same time.\n\nMaru's dominance continued in [[2016 Proleague/Round 3|Round 3]].  He defeated [[Dear]], [[TY]] and [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]], but suffered his first losses of the year against [[Super (Korean player)|Super]] and [[Hush]].  Despite that, [[Jin Air Green Wings]] once again finished first and was seeded into the Finals of the Round 3 Playoffs.  Maru did not participate in the match as [[Cure]] and [[sOs]] each recorded two victories to grant [[Jin Air Green Wings]] the victory.  Maru finished Proleague with a 16-2 record (20-4 including Playoffs).  His contributions to [[Jin Air Green Wings]] during all three rounds of Proleague gave them the first overall seed going into the [[2016 Proleague/Playoffs|Grand Playoffs]].\n\nAt the same time, Maru played in the [[2016 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code A|GSL Code A]] and [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Challenge|SSL Challenge]], once again on consecutive days.  On June 22, Maru defeated TvT specialist [[Reality]] to advance to Code S.  Maru's six-man group in [[2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2/Challenge|SSL Season 2 Challenge]] contained [[Reality]], [[Zest]], [[Super (Korean player)|Super]], [[Losira]] and [[herO(jOin)|herO]].  He finished with a 4-6 record, eliminated from the competition.  Nearly a month later, on July 15, Maru played in [[2016 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code S|Code S]].  After beating [[soO]] 2-1 and [[RagnaroK]] 2-0, Maru advanced from Group D in first place.  During the Round of 16 Group Nomination, Maru was the second to last player selected, placing him into Group C with [[Dear]], [[ByuL]] and [[MyuNgSiK]].  These matches were played on August 17, 2016.  They would prove to be Maru's last in either of the two major Starleagues in 2016.\n\nMaru's first match was against [[MyuNgSiK]].  He lost 2-1.  Paired up against [[ByuL]] in the loser's match, Maru managed a 2-0 victory.  He would end up playing long time rival [[Dear]] in the final match.  [[Dear]] claimed a decisive 2-0 victory to eliminate Maru from the competition.  This left Maru with 900 [[2016 StarCraft II World Championship Series/Standings|WCS Points]], rendering him ineligible for the [[2016 WCS Global Playoffs and Finals|2016 WCS Global Finals]].\n\nOn September 3, 2016 Maru participated in the [[2016 Proleague/Playoffs|Proleague Grand Finals]] alongside his team, the [[Jin Air Green Wings]].  Facing off against [[KT Rolster]] in the Proleague best of seven format, Maru was paired against [[TY]] on [[King Sejong Station]] in the second match.  After [[Cure]] won the initial game of the series, Maru claimed victory with masterful Tank/Medivac play to put the [[Jin Air Green Wings]] ahead 2-0.  After victories by [[Trap]] and [[sOs]], the [[Jin Air Green Wings]] were crowned Champions of [[2016 Proleague]] by a score of 4-0.\nMaru was named MVP of [[2016 Proleague/Playoffs|Proleague Grand Finals]].  His record at season's end, including playoffs, was 22-4.  His 85% win rate far exceeded anyone else in [[2016 Proleague|Proleague]].  The most wins by a player with equal or less losses was [[MC]] with a 4-3 mark and only [[Stats]] posted more total victories (27).\n\nOn September 30, Maru played in Group D along with [[Patience]], [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]] and [[Nerchio]] of the [[2016 KeSPA Cup]].  He fell to [[Patience]] in the first match by a score of 2-0.  Paired up against [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo)|Classic]] in the Loser's match, Maru would win 2-1, placing him in the Final Match of Group D.  It was in this match against [[Nerchio]], a player who had reportedly labeled Maru as \"overrated\" in an interview prior to the Group being played, that Maru would claim a 2-1 victory.  This win had him advance out of his group in second place.\nIn the Round of 8 of the KeSPA Cup, Maru was seeded to face [[Stats]], who Maru has posted an 11-2 record against since 2015, including 9 consecutive game wins.  Maru would take a 2-1 lead against Stats in their Best of 5 match before losing games 4 and 5 to fall by a score of 3-2, eliminating him from the tournament.\n\n===2017 - 2018===\n\nOn 8 December 2017, he successfully qualified along with [[Dark]] and [[Classic]] for the upcoming offline event WESG Asia-Pacific Qualifier from second place with wins over Forte and Solar. Later that month, Maru qualified for the first GSL of 2018, albeit only on the second day of qualifiers. In January of 2018, Maru was able to qualify for the [[World Electronic Sports Games 2017]] Main Event in China from the Asia-Pacific Qualifier rather easily, although health issues prevented him from achieving a better result than 4th place. He advanced from his Ro32 and Ro16 GSL groups despite an upset loss to [[KeeN]] in the earlier round.\n\nIn late February online qualifiers for the upcoming [[IEM Season XII - World Championship|IEM World Championship]] in Katowice were held. While Maru failed to qualify for the event in this way, he and his teammates went to Poland to play in the open bracket, which he and Trap advanced from. After losing to TY and Dear in the group stage but beating all remaining players in his group, Maru started facing his teammates. He managed to edge out sOs in a very close 3-2 series and afterwards went up 2-0 against Rogue, but his tournament run was ended in a reverse sweep. \n\nIn mid-March 2018, Maru was scheduled to play in the 2017 WESG Main Event just a few days after his GSL Ro8 match, in which he once again overcame sOs 3-2. At WESG, he showed good form as he went through both group stages with only a single map loss to ShoWTimE. After disposing of Reynor and Serral with 3-0 score lines each, Maru had once again reached the grand finals of WESG. This time it was him who took home the grand prize, overcoming Dark in a nail-biting series and catching him off guard in the 7th and final game with a 2 barracks proxy.\n\nLess than a week removed from WESG, Dark and Maru faced off in a rematch to decide who would join Stats in the GSL finals. The series was once again of the highest quality, with Maru emerging victorious once more, 4-2 this time. Only days later, it was time for Maru's first GSL final. Showing off his ability to prepare for a longer series, Maru caught Stats off-guard with a variety of different strategies the Protoss didn't have enough answers for. As the dust settled, Maru stood victorious and became the first (and likely only) player to win an OSL, an SSL and a GSL.\n\nAs GSL champion, Maru was naturally invited to the [[2018 AfreecaTV GSL Super Tournament 1|Super Tournament]]. His first round match against soO is most notable for soO's computer crashing in the super late game during game 4. Instead of attempting to resume the match from replay, soO rather forfeited the match outright, seeing no chance to win from his position anyway. However, Maru's tournament life came to an end at the hands of Classic in a rather sloppy series.\n\n====Back to back champion====\n\nSeeded into [[2018 Global StarCraft II League Season 2/Code S|GSL]] and equipped with the right to choose the first player he wants to face in the Ro32, Maru's group ended up containing Zanster, Bunny and Dear. Although Maru struggled a little bit to take down Zanster, he advanced in first place with no map losses. In the groups selection ceremony for the Ro16, being the champion of last season, Maru opted to choose Patience first. He convinced Patience to pick Solar who subsequently chose Zest. After the groups were seemingly completed, Maru used the right of the first seed to swap INnoVation with GuMiho in an attempt to help sOs. While Patience ended up putting up an impressive fight, Maru only dropped a single game to win his group once more.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, he faced Rogue in yet another teamkill. The two were closely matched, but eventually Maru took the series 3-2. Then, in the semifinals he met his old enemy Classic. At the time, there was little doubt Classic was the best PvT player in the world, having only dropped a single series since [[Patch 4.0.0]] had been released<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aligulac.com/players/186/results/?after=2017-11-16&before=2018-06-15&event=&race=t&country=all&bestof=all&offline=both&game=all&wcs_season=&wcs_tier=&op=|title=Classic's PvT winrate|date=2018-06-15|publisher=aligulac.com}}</ref>. Aided by his strong preparation and a [[Patch 4.3.0|recent balance patch]] that buffed marauders and made the earlier stages of the game more favorable for Terran, Maru took the series 4-1. Maru met Zest in the GSL finals and handed him a crushing 4-0 defeat to become the first GSL champion to defend his title since NesTea did the same 7 years prior.\n\nGoing into the [[2018 Global StarCraft II League Season 3/Code S|3rd season of GSL of the year]], Maru once again won his Ro32 group, although he had some unexpected trouble with Leenock. Maru's struggles against Zerg became more evident at [[2018 GSL vs. the World|GSL vs the World]], as he struggled to take down soO, just barely winning the 5th and final game of their series. What followed was an easy win against ShoWTimE and a very intense series against Stats that Maru ended up losing 1-3. The team portion of the event didn't go much better for Maru, whose hand-picked team lost 2-5, he himself suffering a defeat at the hands of Serral, the eventual GSL vs the World champion.\n\nFor his Ro16 group, he picked [[Neeb]], who in turn picked [[Impact]]. At the end of the group selections Maru used his power as the first seed to swap [[TY]] with [[Reynor]]. Maru ended up facing the two foreigners, defeating Neeb 2-0 but having some troubles with Reynor before clawing his way through.\n\nIn the round of 8, he beat [[Gumiho]] 3-0 before playing against [[Zest]]. In a rematch of the previous season's finals, Maru again showed his dominance with a 4-1. However, Maru finally faced what would prove to be his toughest challenge in the finals yet, [[TY]]. After claming he would have swapped TY instead of his teammate had they both gone to his group, many believed Maru to be scared of TY. The actual finals lived up to the hype, as the series went the full 7 games. Maru, keeping to his style of the year, proxied 5 games out of the 7, including the first 4 games. After falling down 2-3, he returned to a proxy, which ended up being successful. TY actually did not die to a proxy outright in a single game this series, but none of this mattered on map 7, GSL Atlas SE, a 4 player map. Despite falling behind over 10 supply and a failed cloaked banshee transition by Maru, he pulled his SCVs with two tanks, some marines, one cyclone, and two banshees and barely pushed through TY's defense for his 3rd GSL Code S in a row.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Was described as a \"Little teddy bear\" by Lani during [[IGN ProLeague Season 4]].<ref>[https://www.twitch.tv/iplliveu/b/314371855 Interview with Lani (begins 1:29:30)]</ref>\n*Is the youngest [[Royal Roader]] in OSL history and the first [[eSF]] OSL champion.\n*When Maru won his OSL title, he was one of two remaining players (alongside [[KangHo]]) from the [[2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1|2010 GSL Open Season 1]] still in Code S/Premier League.\n*Was listed on [[Greatest Players of All Time]] list on TL as 13th.\n*Is the first double Royal Roader in Starcraft 2 and second double Royal Roader after [[BoxeR]] in Starcraft's history after he won  [[2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1]].\n*Maru is one of the Four Horsemen of Terran, alongside [[INnoVation]], [[TY]], and [[ByuN]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.intelextrememasters.com/news/iem-shanghai-2017-group-d-preview-and-predictions/|title=IEM Shanghai Group D Preview|date=2017-07-26|author=Karin Krisher|publisher=ESL}}</ref>\n*Surpassed [[Rogue]] as the biggest money earner at the time in Starcraft II after his WESG victory.

He was in the same group with [[StarNaN]], [[Joe]] and [[Buddha]] and managed to advance to the main bracket by placing 2nd in his group by only dropping two games against the group winner, [[StarNaN]].\nIn the main bracket Serral was put up against [[Seiplo]], who defeated Serral by a score of 2-1.\n\n===World Championship Series===\n====2012 WCS Finland Nationals====\nOn July 28, 2012, Serral participated in the [[2012 StarCraft II World Championship Series/Europe/Nationals/Finland|World Championship Series 2012 Finland]] event. He was one of the eight players to qualify for the event through [[Vectorama 2012]]. Serral lost against [[Welmu]] in round 1 and fell into the losers bracket where he managaed to beat [[grim]] and [[Winsti]], but failing to defeat [[elfi]] in round 3. Serral finished 7th/8th along with [[Core (Player)|core]], winning $200.\n\n==Heart of the Swarm==\nOn April 23, 2013, it was announced that Serral had joined [[Ence eSports]]. He became the second StarCraft II player in their roster, along with [[elfi]], who became, according to the team, his personal mentor.<ref name=\"ence\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ence.fi/joona-serral-sotala-liittyy-joukkueeseen/|accessdate=2013-04-23|date=2013-04-23|publisher=Ence.fi|title=Serral joins Ence}}</ref>\n\nSerral made an impressive run at [[2013 DreamHack Open/Bucharest|2013 DreamHack Open: Bucharest]] on September 14, 2013. After topping his 3-player group in the [[2013 DreamHack Open/Bucharest/Group Stage 1|first group stage]], he played against [[SuperNova]], [[pal]], and [[TargA]] in the [[2013 DreamHack Open/Bucharest/Group Stage 2|second group stage]]. His match against SuperNova was not originally planned to be featured, however due to delays to the [[DIMAGA]] vs. [[Flash]] series, it was casted on the main stream. Despite losing the series 0-2, his performance was impressive regardless and was mentioned in the TL.net tournament recap.<ref>[https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=429291 TaeJa wins DH Bucharest and other tales]</ref> After defeating [[pal]] and [[TargA]] 2-0 each, he advanced to the [[2013 DreamHack Open/Bucharest/Group Stage 3|third group stage]] to play against three notable Koreans, [[Jaedong]], [[CranK]], and [[ForGG]]. After winning only a single game in the group against Jaedong, Serral was eliminated before reaching the bracket stage.\n\nAfter [[Ence eSports]] disbanded, Serral joined [[mYinsanity]] on February 24, 2014.<ref>[http://myinsanity.eu/myinsanity-welcomes-serral/ mYinsanity welcomes Serral] myinsanity.eu</ref>\n\n==Legacy of the Void==\n====2016====\nSerral played at [[Assembly Winter 2016]], and proceeded to the finals without dropping a single map. In the grand finals he played against [[Namshar]] and took the series 4-2.\n\nOn October 4, Serral transferred to [[Ence eSports]] from [[mYinsanity]].\n\nOn October 20, Serral took part in the first [[TaKe%27s_Penthouse_Party|Take's Penthouse Party]], a smaller version of the popular [[HomeStory_Cup|HomeStory Cup tournaments]]. Serral cruised through the winners' bracket, facing off against [[HeRoMaRinE]] in the finals. The Finnish Zerg took down the German Terran player 4-1, earning Serral a lion's share of the $4,350 prize pool.\n\n====2017====\nIn January, Serral qualified for the [[IEM Season XI - World Championship]]. In the final qualifiers he dropped down to the losers' bracket in the first round, but was able to hold on, eventually defeating [[Elazer]] 3-0 to qualify for the main event. At the Spodek Arena, Serral topped his group with a 4-1 match score, making his way to the quarterfinals. There he met [[Dark]] and lost 0-3, ending his run.\n\nHaving qualified for [[2017_WCS_Jönköping|WCS Jönköping]], Serral started out directly in the third group stage. He topped his group with a map score of 4-1, taking down [[MaNa]] and [[Scarlett]]. He made his way from the Ro16 all the way to the grand finals, defeating [[Stephano]], [[PtitDrogo]] and [[Elazer]], and dropping only a single map on the way. In the finals he met the North American Protoss [[Neeb]].  The two had met less than two months prior at the [[2017_WCS_Austin|WCS Austin]] quarterfinals, where Neeb had been the victor with a 3-1 score. The two traded blows, taking the series all the way to the last map but in the end it was Neeb who emerged victorious from game 7. With a 3-4 loss, Serral had make do with a silver medal. The second place finish would also eventually prove to be his best WCS result of the year.\n\nOn September 30, Serral played in [[TaKe's Penthouse Party 3]].

Serral placed second in his group, his only loss against [[ShoWTimE]]. He was able to advance from the Ro12 against [[Majestic]], and took down [[uThermal]] in the quarterfinals. Following a quick 3-0 semifinal victory against [[Elazer]], Serral met [[Nerchio]] in the finals. He defeated the Polish Zerg player with a 4-0 clean sweep, earning himself both his first offline victory of 2017 and his largest prize pool yet.\n\n====2018====\nStarting the year, Serral participated in the [[2018_WCS_Leipzig/Qualifiers/Europe|WCS Leipzig qualifier]]. Because the tournament organizer had inadvertently drawn up the brackets wrong, Serral at first thought he had qualified for the main event. After the admins caught the issue, Serral, along with the other players in the playoffs, was forced to play his matches again. In the revised bracket, he took down [[Harstem]] 3-0, followed by defeating [[Nerchio]] likewise 3-0. In the finals he met [[Elazer]], and the Polish Zerg player was able to finally stop Serral's run. Nevertheless, Serral held on to his qualification spot for Leipzig.\n\nAt [[2018_WCS_Leipzig|Leipzig proper]], Serral started out in the third group stage. An all-Zerg group, he took down [[Stephano]] and [[Namshar]] to advance to the round-of-16. Once in the playoffs, he was able to advance to the grand finals by taking down [[MaSa]], [[Nerchio]] and [[SpeCial]], only losing a single map on the way. In the finals he met [[ShoWTimE]], the German hometown favorite. Serral first took the series to 3-0, with ShoWTimE not able to keep up in the longer macro games. On match point, Serral moved to more aggressive openings, trying to catch the German Protoss off-guard. Much to Serral's chagrin, ShoWTimE was able to hold fast against the Zerg aggression for two games in a row, bringing the score to 3-2. In the sixth map, Serral was able to finally close out the series, winning his first ever Premier title and a guaranteed spot to BlizzCon 2018.\n\nHaving qualified for [[IEM_Season_XII_-_PyeongChang|IEM Pyeongchang]] in December 2017, Serral was placed against the Colombian Zerg [[eGGz]] in the bracket. The Finn won his first match in a clean sweep 3-0, and advanced to play against [[Scarlett]]. The Canadian Zerg player was able to turn the tables on Serral, taking the series 3-1 and ending Serral's Pyeongchang run in the quarterfinals.\n\nAt [[IEM_Season_XII_-_World_Championship|IEM Katowice]] Serral participated in the offline qualifiers in the Ro76. He played in Bracket #2 on the first day. He plowed through his bracket, winning three matches in a row, and ensuring himself a spot in the main group stage of the tournament. There he played five matches in Group C. Serral took down [[Rogue]], [[Impact]], [[Neeb]], [[Zest]] and [[Nerchio]] in a row, only losing two maps on the way, and securing his spot in the quarterfinals. Facing [[Trap]] for the semifinals spot, Serral lost the first two games, but clawed his way back from the 0-2 position to win the series 3-2.\n\nOn championship Sunday, Serral was pitted against [[Classic (Kim Doh Woo){{!}}Classic]] in the Ro4. The Protoss opened the first game with a strong unscouted charge-zealot push, catching Serral wholly unprepared. In the second game it was Serral who opted for an all-in, flooding zerglings into Classic's base. The Protoss was not fazed, however, and with a strong build and a good defense, was able to repel Serral's attacks. The third game was slightly longer than the first two, but in the end Classic's stronger tech was able to overcome Serral's lurker-heavy style. With a 0-3 result, Serral was unable to advance past the semifinals.\n\nNine days after IEM Serral took part in the [[World Electronic Sports Games 2017|WESG 2017]] tournament. In group stages 1 and 2 he would face notable non-Koreans such as [[ShoWTimE]], [[Elazer]] and [[Bly]], but Serral would not drop a single map in the six series he played before playoffs. After going 15-0 Serral was seeded to play against [[Neeb]] in the quarterfinals. The beginning of the first two games started out strong for the protoss opponent, but Serral managed to crawl back into the games  with his harassment that kept Neeb on his own side of the map. Serral would then finish off the series with ling aggression to take himself to play against [[Maru]], who had only dropped one game before facing Serral. In their lengthy series against each other the top terran 3-0'd Serral with great usage of ravens and ghosts being a noticeable part of it. As a result Serral faced [[Classic]] in the 3rd-place match, where after the rocky start he was able to take revenge from their IEM series.
