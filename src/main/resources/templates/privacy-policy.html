                Blizzard API data is collected and stored in the DB. We aggregate the data, index it, and derive useful
                statistics from it. This data is displayed on different platforms such as our website and Discord bot
                to improve experience of players.

            <h4>Blizzard data retention</h4>
            <p>
                We strictly follow the <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/a2989b50-5f16-43b1-abec-2ae17cc09dd6/blizzard-developer-api-terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blizzard ToS</a>,
                which forces us to permanently delete
                the data within 30 days after it was deleted from the Blizzard's API. Bear in mind that StartCraft&reg;2 leaderboards are
                <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/data-protection-notice-and-faq/609/2"
                   target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deemed as public data(section 15)</a>. You can remove some
                of your data by submitting a data removal request to Blizzard, disabling 3rd party access in settings of your
                Blizzard account, or using the <a th:href="@{/data/battle-net}">BattleNet data manager</a>. We update affected
                player data of the last

                <h5>Revealed/Unmasked accounts</h5>
                <p>
                    Account revealing is based on public data and will not be removed. We usually remove some info if
                    users request it, but this is a special case because account removal will trigger a chain reaction
                    from other users and the whole feature will be useless.
